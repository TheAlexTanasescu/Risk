## Project Proposal: Risk 
A strategy board game of which the objective is to dominate territories. Players have a limited amount of pieces which they can place onto a map. In order to win one must gain control over all the territories on the map. Battles occur when player wish to take over an adjacent territory. The victor of battles between players are determined through the rolling of dice. The amount of dice rolled depends on the number of pieces on a territory. The player with a higher number pieces on a territory has a higher chance defending/attacking territories, but is not guaranteed to win the battle. Thus adding the element of risk.


### HOW TO RUN THE TEXT-BASED VERSION OF THE GAME
1) Make sure you have the JRE (JavaSE 1.8), you can download it here -
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html
2) Go to the project repository and download it, here's the link, https://github.com/TrishaRicalde/Risk
3) Open terminal or command prompt and navigate to where Risk-Text.jar is (to the repository folder "Risk") 
4) Type in "java -jar Risk-Text.jar"


### HOW TO RUN THE GUI/INTERACTIVE VERSION OF THE GAME
1) Make sure you have the JRE (JavaSE 1.8), you can download it here -
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html
2) Download the project repository, here's the link, https://github.com/TrishaRicalde/Risk
3) Run Risk.jar by double clicking on it (or running java -jar Risk.jar in command prompt/terminal while you're in the directory where the file is)

4) If this step is still up,

4) If this step is still in the readMe this means we were unable to export the interactive version to a jar file and what you should do in this case is to clone this project on your computer (go in terminal or command prompt and type in "git clone https://github.com/TrishaRicalde/Risk.git" (make sure you have git installed))and import and run it in an IDE such as eclipse (download at https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or intellij (download at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac) the file you should run is com.Gui.main.Game.java
